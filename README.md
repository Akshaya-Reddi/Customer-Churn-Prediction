# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services. This project builds an end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using demographic and service usage data.

## Dataset
- IBM Watson Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Total Records: 7,043
- Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

## Best Model
- Logistic Regression (highest recall & F1-score)
- Gradient Boosting (balanced performance)

## Key Insights
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn
- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability
- Recall and ROC-AUC are more important than accuracy for churn prediction

## Future Improvements
- Web app deployment
- Real-time prediction
- Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME)
